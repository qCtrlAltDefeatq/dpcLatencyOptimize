explanation:
                      we create a shortcut to the REAL.exe with the --tray argument wich is going to start the program hidden.
                      we put the shortcut into the windows startup folder so it gets executed automaticly at each startup.
                      then we use dpclat.exe to verify that the latency was optimized.
